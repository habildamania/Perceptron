# Perceptron
This code shows the basic working of a perceptron. A perceptron is a single neuron which accepts 'n' inputs each associated with a weight vector 'wi' for every 'xi' input and a bias 'w0'. It performs one forward pass and calculates the sum of all wi*xi called the summing function and passes it to a sign function which predicts the class of the data instance. The sign function assigns class 1 to positive values and class 0 to negative values. After every forward pass, the error is calculated for the data instance and using stochastic gradient descent optimization technique, the weight vectors are updated so that error at output becomes 0.
